# frees-workshop: Building Purely Functional Microservices

In this workshop you will learn how to build from scratch a purely functional application and expose it as a microservice with Freestyle and Freestyle RPC.

This will be a hands on coding session where we will architect a small application based on Algebras and Modules that can be exposed as an RPC microservice supporting Protobuf and Avro serialization protocols.

## Basic Freestyle Structure

We are going to use the [freestyle-seed](https://github.com/frees-io/freestyle-seed.g8) [giter8](https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8) template to create the basic project structure:

```bash
sbt new frees-io/freestyle-seed.g8
```

Result:

```bash
name [Project Name]: frees-rpc-workshop
projectDescription [Project Description]:  Freestyle at Scala eXchange
project [project-name]: functional-microservices
package [freestyle]: scalaexchange
freesVersion [0.4.6]:

Template applied in ./frees-rpc-workshop
```

Run the example:

```bash
cd frees-rpc-workshop
sbt run
```

## App Domain and Data Generator

In this section we'll see the different models that we will be using along the workshop.

Before that, let's add some new sbt settings (and sbt modules) to be able to put our code in the right place.

Add the following to your project's `build.sbt` file:

* Common Settings and dependency we'll use for every module in our project:

```scala
lazy val commonSettings: Seq[Def.Setting[_]] = Seq(
  resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("beyondthelines", "maven"),
  addCompilerPlugin("org.scalameta" % "paradise" % "3.0.0-M10" cross CrossVersion.full),
  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "io.frees" %% "frees-core" % freesV,
    "io.frees" %% "frees-rpc" % "0.4.1",
    "org.scalameta" %% "scalameta" % "1.8.0"),
  scalacOptions += "-Xplugin-require:macroparadise",
  scalacOptions in(Compile, console) ~= (_ filterNot (_ contains "paradise")) // macroparadise plugin doesn't work in repl yet.
)
```

* Modify the current settings in our current `functional-microservices` sbt module, you can use the following configuration:

```scala
// Common module:
lazy val `functional-microservices` = project
  .in(file("."))
  .settings(name := "functional-microservices")
  .settings(moduleName := "functional-microservices")
  .settings(description := "Freestyle at Scala eXchange")
  .settings(commonSettings)
```

* Remove all the code provided by the giter8 template (you can just directly remove the `scalaexchange` folder/package), since we are building everything from scratch in the next steps. In fact, from now on, `functional-microservices` sbt module will be used as the common build, which it'll be visible for the rest of the sbt modules.

* Our model, that could be placed in the common space within our project ([./src/main/scala](./src/main/scala)):

  * [./src/main/scala/models.scala](./src/main/scala/models.scala):

```scala
package scalaexchange

sealed trait EventType
case object ProcessedCheckout   extends EventType
case object UnprocessedCheckout extends EventType
case object Login               extends EventType

case class UserEvent(userId: Int, eventType: EventType, date: String)
```

  * [./src/main/scala/errors.scala](./src/main/scala/errors.scala):

```scala
package scalaexchange

case class DataGenerationException(message: String, maybeCause: Option[Throwable] = None)
  extends RuntimeException(message) {

  maybeCause foreach initCause
}
```

* Now, let's define three new `sbt` modules, also in our `build.sbt`, at once that will be needed later on:

```scala
// Data Generator:
lazy val `data-generator` =
  project.in(file("data-generator"))
    .settings(moduleName := "data-generator")
    .settings(commonSettings)
    .aggregate(`functional-microservices`)
    .dependsOn(`functional-microservices`)
    .settings(
      libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        "joda-time" % "joda-time" % "2.9.9",
        "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.0.0-M2",
        "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.13.4",
        "com.47deg" %% "scalacheck-toolbox-datetime" % "0.2.3"
      )
    )

// RPC definitions and implementations:
lazy val services = project
  .in(file("services"))
  .settings(moduleName := "rpc-services")
  .settings(commonSettings)
  .aggregate(`functional-microservices`)
  .dependsOn(`functional-microservices`)

// Our application where we will test everything we are building:
lazy val app = project
  .in(file("app"))
  .settings(moduleName := "app")
  .settings(commonSettings)
  .aggregate(`data-generator`, services)
  .dependsOn(`data-generator`, services)
```

* Streaming Data Generation: you can copy this code verbatim from this path [./data-generator/src/main/scala/](./data-generator/src/main/scala/) inside the `data-generator` sbt module folder, given this code is out of the scope of this workshop. Notice that this should be under the `data-generator` folder.

* Checkpoint: let's test this streaming data generation before moving onto the next section. We create the `AppStreamingService` class inside the `app` sbt module folder([./app/src/main/scala/AppStreamingService.scala](./app/src/main/scala/AppStreamingService.scala)). Notice that this should be under the `app` folder.

```scala
package scalaexchange

import monix.execution.Scheduler

import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration

object AppStreamingService {

  implicit val S: Scheduler = monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val streamingService: StreamingService = new StreamingService

    Await.ready(streamingService.userEventsStream.completedL.runAsync, Duration.Inf)
  }

}
```

Now you can run this application:

```bash
sbt app/run
```

The output should be similar to:

```bash
[info] Running scalaexchange.AppStreamingService
* New Event 👍  --> UserEvent(76,ProcessedCheckout,2017-12-14T15:25:48.820Z)
* New Event 👍  --> UserEvent(21,UnprocessedCheckout,2017-12-05T05:08:20.558Z)

* New Event 👍  --> UserEvent(74,ProcessedCheckout,2017-12-07T03:36:50.931Z)

... // Feel free to stop it, it has no end.
```

## Freestyle RPC - Protocols and Services

Previously, we added the `frees-rpc` dependency to your project's `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.frees" %% "frees-rpc" % "0.4.1"
```

Hence, we are able to start with the definition and implementation of our microservices, using `frees-rpc`. Everything in this section will happen in the `services` sbt module.

First of all, we are going to move the common implicits to a common place, since we need to start thinking in that we will have several runnable parts, like server and client applications.

At this point, we only need to move the implicit `ExecutionContext` to our common space. Hence, pick it up from `scalaexchange.app.AppStreamingService` and create the following object to put it there (file path [./src/main/scala/implicits.scala](./src/main/scala/implicits.scala)):

```scala
package scalaexchange

import monix.execution.Scheduler

trait CommonImplicits {

  implicit val S: Scheduler = monix.execution.Scheduler.Implicits.global

}

object implicits extends CommonImplicits
```

Next, change the class `AppStreamingService` accordingly:

```scala
package scalaexchange
package app

import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration.Duration
import scalaexchange.datagenerator.StreamingService

object AppStreamingService extends CommonImplicits {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val streamingService: StreamingService = new StreamingService

    Await.ready(streamingService.userEventsStream.completedL.runAsync, Duration.Inf)
  }

}
```

Let's focus now in the most important part of this section: create a protocol definition with a service implementation, with the help of [Freestyle RPC](https://github.com/frees-io/freestyle-rpc).

### Protocol Definition

In this first approach, we'll define a simple unary service, receiving an empty request and returning a single response. In fact, we are defining a service which will return the set of segments that our `RFM` microservices will manage from now on, in order to clasify the different users.

* Segment definition:
  * title: String
  * minRecency: Int
  * maxRecency: Int
  * minFrequency: Int
  * maxFrequency: Int
  * minMonetary: Int
  * maxMonetary: Int
* Example showing the list of Segments that our service could return:
  * Segment("Champions", 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5)
  * Segment("Loyal Customers", 2, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5)
  * Segment("Potential Loyalist", 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3)
  * Segment("New Customers", 4, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1)
  * Segment("Customers Needing Attention", 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1)
  * Segment("About To Sleep", 2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2)
  * Segment("Can't Lose Them", 0, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5)
  * Segment("At Risk", 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5)
  * Segment("Hibernating", 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
  * Segment("Lost", 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2)
* Protocol Definition, which we are going to define it at [./services/src/main/scala/protocol.scala](./services/src/main/scala/protocol.scala), as shown below:

```scala
package scalaexchange
package services

import freestyle.rpc.protocol._

object protocol {

  final case class Segment(
      title: String,
      minRecency: Int,
      maxRecency: Int,
      minFrequency: Int,
      maxFrequency: Int,
      minMonetary: Int,
      maxMonetary: Int
  )

  final case class SegmentList(list: List[Segment])

  @service
  trait RFMAnalysisService[F[_]] {

    @rpc(Avro) def segments(empty: Empty.type): F[SegmentList]

  }

}
```

Notice the `@service` and `@rpc(Avro)` annotations, both are provided by Freestyle RPC. The first one allows to define an RPC service. The second one though, brings us the ability to define an RPC service. In this case, we are serialising with `Avro` but `Protocol Buffers` is also supported (in that case you should use `Protobuf` instead).

### Service Implementation

So far so good, what about the implementation? Initially, let's provide a simple implementation to serve the user segment list (`SegmentList`). We could do it at [./services/src/main/scala/runtime/RFMAnalysisServiceHandler.scala](./services/src/main/scala/runtime/RFMAnalysisServiceHandler.scala):

```scala
package scalaexchange
package services
package runtime

import cats.Applicative
import freestyle.rpc.protocol._

import scalaexchange.services.protocol._

class RFMAnalysisServiceHandler[F[_]: Applicative] extends RFMAnalysisService[F] {

  private[this] val segmentList: List[Segment] = List(
    Segment("Champions", 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5),
    Segment("Loyal Customers", 2, 5, 3, 5, 3, 5),
    Segment("Potential Loyalist", 3, 5, 1, 3, 1, 3),
    Segment("New Customers", 4, 5, 0, 1, 0, 1),
    Segment("Customers Needing Attention", 3, 4, 0, 1, 0, 1),
    Segment("About To Sleep", 2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2),
    Segment("Can't Lose Them", 0, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5),
    Segment("At Risk", 0, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5),
    Segment("Hibernating", 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2),
    Segment("Lost", 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2)
  )

  override def segments(empty: Empty.type): F[protocol.SegmentList] =
    Applicative[F].pure(SegmentList(segmentList))

}
```

As you can see, we are hardcoding the segment list, nonetheless, this list could be fetched from a database, but we are good for now with this dummy implementation.

As takeaways, with this protocol definition, we have two things:

* A service that can be attached to any RPC server.
* Auto-derived rpc client of this service.

In the next section, we are going to see both pieces in action, end-to-end.

## RPC Server and RPC Client usage

As we mentioned at the end of the last section, we are:

* Bootstrapping an RPC Server (on port `8080`, for example). Before doing that, we need to bind the previous service to this server.
* Invoke the service from the client side, using the auto-generated client for the previously defined protocol.

For both challenges, we need to apply effects to an specific concurrent Monad. We've chosen `cats.effect.IO`, from [cats-effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect), but could be any other. For this reason, we are adding to our [build.sbt](./build.sbt) file the sbt dependency, which it'll be provided transitively by [frees-async-cats-effect](https://github.com/frees-io/freestyle/tree/master/modules/async/async-cats-effect/shared/src) Freestyle integration. This integration basically provides an `AsyncContext` for `cats.effect.IO`.

Add the following to the `commonSettings`:

```scala
"io.frees"  %% "frees-async-cats-effect" % freesV
```

We've not finished with the [build.sbt](./build.sbt) file yet, since we need to add a new sbt module to place our RPC Server code:

```scala
// RPC Server.
lazy val server = project
  .in(file("server"))
  .settings(moduleName := "rpc-server")
  .settings(commonSettings)
  .aggregate(services)
  .dependsOn(services)
```

### RPC Server

All the code about this subsection will be placed at `server.scala` in [./server/src/main/scala/](./server/src/main/scala/).

* Concurrent Monad definition. In this case we could add a type alias for simplicity. This might be placed inside a `package object`, for example:

```scala
package scalaexchange

import cats.effect.IO

package object serverapp {

  type ConcurrentMonad[A] = IO[A]

  val port: Int = 8080

}
```

* Implicit Runtime evidences. At least we need to provide:
  * An `FSHandler` (Natural Transformation) instance of the service defined before.
  * Server configuration, where we will bind the `RFMAnalysis` service and configure the tcp port to `8080`.
  
  This is done at `implicits.scala` in [./server/src/main/scala/](./server/src/main/scala/)

```scala
package scalaexchange
package serverapp

import cats.{~>, Applicative}
import freestyle.rpc.server.handlers.GrpcServerHandler
import freestyle.rpc.server._
import freestyle.rpc.server.implicits._
import scalaexchange.services.protocol.RFMAnalysisService

import scalaexchange.services.runtime.RFMAnalysisServiceHandler

trait Implicits extends scalaexchange.CommonImplicits {

  implicit def rfmAnalisysServiceHandler[F[_]: Applicative]: RFMAnalysisServiceHandler[F] =
    new RFMAnalysisServiceHandler[F]

  val grpcConfigs: List[GrpcConfig] = List(
    AddService(
      RFMAnalysisService.bindService[ConcurrentMonad]
    )
  )

  implicit def grpcServerHandler: GrpcServer.Op ~> ConcurrentMonad =
    new GrpcServerHandler[ConcurrentMonad] andThen
      new GrpcKInterpreter[ConcurrentMonad](ServerW(port, grpcConfigs).server)

}
```

Notice `import freestyle.rpc.server.implicits._`, which is providing all we need to bootstrap the server, in terms of common async instances and so on.

* Finally, how the **Server** would look like?
  Have a look to `ServerApp.scala` in [./server/src/main/scala/](./server/src/main/scala/)


```scala
package scalaexchange
package serverapp

import freestyle._
import freestyle.rpc.server._
import freestyle.rpc.server.implicits._

object ServerApp extends scalaexchange.serverapp.Implicits {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
    server[GrpcServerApp.Op].interpret[ConcurrentMonad].unsafeRunSync()

}
```

To run the server, just type:

```bash
sbt server/run
```

### App Client Demo

Now, let's see how the auto-generated client can be used to invoke this service, we'll do it in our [app](./app/src/main/scala) sbt module.

First, let's define some needed instances to setup the client, like the port where the server is listening to the incoming connections.

Let's start with `implicits.scala` in [./app/src/main/scala/](./app/src/main/scala/)

```scala
package scalaexchange
package app

import cats.effect.IO
import freestyle.rpc.client._
import io.grpc.ManagedChannel

trait Implicits extends scalaexchange.CommonImplicits {

  val channelFor: ManagedChannelFor = ManagedChannelForAddress("localhost", 8080)

  val channelConfigList: List[ManagedChannelConfig] = List(UsePlaintext(true))

  val managedChannelInterpreter =
    new ManagedChannelInterpreter[IO](channelFor, channelConfigList)

  val channel: ManagedChannel = managedChannelInterpreter.build(channelFor, channelConfigList)

}
```

Then, let's use the auto-derived client based on the protocol definition of the service.

See `AppRFMClient.scala` in [./app/src/main/scala/](./app/src/main/scala/)

```scala
package scalaexchange
package app

import cats.effect.IO
import freestyle.rpc.protocol.Empty
import freestyle.asyncCatsEffect.implicits._
import freestyle.rpc.client.implicits._

import scalaexchange.services.protocol._

object AppRFMClient extends Implicits {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    implicit val rfmClient: RFMAnalysisService.Client[IO] =
      RFMAnalysisService.client[IO](channel)

    val result: SegmentList = rfmClient.segments(Empty).unsafeRunSync

    println(s"\n${result.list.mkString("\n")}\n")
  }

}
```

Keep in mind two important _imports_ that are making possible this program interpretation by the `ConcurrentMonad`, which is a `cats.effect.IO` type alias, as we mentioned earlier:

```
import freestyle.asyncCatsEffect.implicits._ // From frees-async-cats-effect
import freestyle.rpc.client.implicits._      // From frees-rpc
```

If you ran the server in the previous step, now you can test this client typing the following command:

```bash
sbt "app/runMain scalaexchange.app.AppRFMClient"
```

## Server Streaming

What about streaming? As we already have a data-generator which returns a `Stream` of user events, let's expose it through our `RFMAnalysisService`, as a new RPC endpoint. In this case, we are talking about a kind of server streaming (in other words, `ResponseStreaming`).

* Before moving on, as we are using the data-generator, let's add it as a dependency in our `build.sbt` file:

```scala
// RPC definitions and implementations:
lazy val services = project
  .in(file("services"))
  .settings(moduleName := "rpc-services")
  .settings(commonSettings)
  .aggregate(`functional-microservices`, `data-generator`)
  .dependsOn(`functional-microservices`, `data-generator`)
```

* Now, let's add the new streaming service to our protocol definition. See `protocol.scala `in  [./services/src/main/scala/](./services/src/main/scala/)

```scala
@rpc(Avro)
@stream[ResponseStreaming.type]
def userEvents(empty: Empty.type): F[Observable[UserEvent]]
```

As you might notice, we are exposing a server streaming service that it's returning a `monix.reactive.Observable` enclosing every user event that will be generated by our data-generator. Apart from this streaming returning type, we need to specify that we are creating a _ResponseStreaming_ service, by using the `@stream[ResponseStreaming.type]` annotation.

* Streaming Service implementation: basically we are done in this part since our data-generator is already using a `monix.reactive.Observable` of `UserEvent`.

Look at `RFMAnalysisServiceHandler.scala` in [./services/src/main/scala/runtime/](./services/src/main/scala/runtime/)

```scala
// Local instance of our data-generator streaming service:
private[this] val streamingService = new StreamingService

// ...

override def userEvents(empty: Empty.type): F[Observable[UserEvent]] =
  Applicative[F].pure(streamingService.userEventsStream)
```

* Finally, let's use this new service from our `app` client application. This would be an example.
  Have a look to `AppRFMClient.scala` in [./app/src/main/scala/](./app/src/main/scala/)

```scala
package scalaexchange
package app

import cats.effect.IO
import freestyle.rpc.protocol.Empty
import freestyle.asyncCatsEffect.implicits._
import freestyle.rpc.client.implicits._
import monix.reactive.Observable

import scala.concurrent.Await
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scalaexchange.services.protocol._

object AppRFMClient extends Implicits {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {

    implicit val rfmClient: RFMAnalysisService.Client[IO] =
      RFMAnalysisService.client[IO](channel)

    val (segments: IO[SegmentList], stream: Observable[UserEvent]) =
      (rfmClient.segments(Empty), rfmClient.userEvents(Empty))

    println(s"Segments: \n${segments.unsafeRunSync().list.mkString("\n")}\n")
    Await.ready(
      stream
        .map { u =>
          println(u)
          u
        }
        .completedL
        .runAsync,
      Duration.Inf)
  }

}
```

This was super-easy, wasn't it? Now, we are going to test it 'end2end':

Run Server:

```bash
sbt server/run
```

Run Client Application:

```bash
sbt "app/runMain scalaexchange.app.AppRFMClient"
```

The expected result is that both server and client console outputs will show these generated user events.
